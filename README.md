## About Me

In the About Me section, you'll get to know me better. I'm Iván, a passionate web developer who loves crafting captivating digital experiences. When I'm not coding, you'll find me strumming melodies on my guitar or spending time with my feline companions. My journey into web development started in college, where I built my first website from scratch. Since then, I've been exploring the latest technologies and creating exceptional digital solutions.

## Projects

In the Projects section, you can explore some of the projects I've worked on. These projects are hosted on GitHub and showcase my coding skills in various programming languages. The ProjectList component dynamically fetches my public repositories using the GitHub API, allowing you to filter projects by name and programming language. You can also navigate through different pages of projects using the pagination feature.
